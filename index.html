                <h2>What Am I Doing? A Journey of Discovery!</h2>
                <p>In "The Republic," Plato argues that education should emphasize disciplines such as mathematics, geometry, music, and physical education to help young people develop their minds and character, ultimately empowering them to think deeply and pursue truth. I have a passion for music, excelling in guitar and drums; I love fitness and completed an 846-kilometer graduation ride from Qingdao to Beijing. With an undergraduate background in the sciences, a master's in business, and self-study in engineering, I enjoy reading across various fields. Thus, I proudly declare that I am not just an "excellent sheep"; I seek the eternal exploration of infinite interdisciplinary realms—perhaps this is what we call truth.</p>
                <p>Stephen Hawking, in "A Brief History of Time," asserts that scientists are extreme intellects and ultimate dreamers, the prophets of truth and angels of beauty. In the past, I perceived the world through my senses, pursuing freedom through travel and entrepreneurship; however, a year in the UK taught me to embrace solitude. I opened my sixth sense, discovering the joy that comes from the clarity achieved after grappling with complex ideas in the realm of imagination. The ethereal and mysterious nature of the unknown stirs within me an endless creativity and desire for exploration. I aspire to blend extreme rationality, boundless imagination, and profound aesthetics, creating my own vision of "Iron Man."</p>
                <p>Embrace not the guilt of youthful wanderings;For every varied path taken Shapes the bow drawn taut, Ready to launch one's true potential./勿愧年少四海游，盘弓错马正当时！</p>
